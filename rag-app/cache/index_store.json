When\ndetermining variance in thickness, exclude the outside edges of a mailpiece\n(1 inch from each edge) when the contents do not extend into those edges. Also,\nexclude the selvage of any polywrap covering (see 201.5.3) from this\ndetermination. Mailers must secure nonpaper contents to prevent shifting of\nmore than 2 inches within the mailpiece if shifting would cause the piece to be\nnonuniform in thickness or would result in the contents bursting out of the\nmailpiece (see 601.3.3). 2.5 Ineligible Flat-Size Pieces\nFlat-size mailpieces that do not meet the eligibility standards in 2.3 and 2.4 are\nconsidered parcels, and customers mailing these pieces must pay the applicable\nparcel prices.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"bc4a467f-6a76-4736-954c-7868efaaea0e":{"id_":"bc4a467f-6a76-4736-954c-7868efaaea0e","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/101.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"cYqwFXGb+Df3WDR7Eqk/czF3tgZa7F5O+UbkCTP4hT0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"384dd85b-84ce-4161-9add-ca4d5a538b71","metadata":{},"hash":"Ozambvw9EbayPYOFQ6q/U/A0KQa4pu/nk7Z5XafcRQE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3e743ddb-c234-48f3-9529-182dfb171e3d","metadata":{},"hash":"QP4lgy5UR8v8UzbWbScoNm70qm9RWZfn0yaj7syl+4E="}},"hash":"K+glkdXdBJ4uSBGLoSlcH0tyeDeLTT5Tmm6x4hznkNo=","text":"3.0 Physical Standards for Parcels\n3.1 Processing Categories\nUSPS categorizes parcels into one of three mail processing categories:\nmachinable, irregular, or nonmachinable parcel.

When transferring technology from the research lab into mass manufactured products, it?s vital to\nstart with a deep understanding of both core science and technology readiness, to ensure the\nresulting product design is robust, safe, delivered on time, and primed for commercial success. Our highly qualified scientists work closely with our wider innovation teams to undertake the\nresearch, theoretical analysis, modeling, and lab-based experimentation to provide a firm foundation\nfor successful product realization. With a proud portfolio of products that are effective, robust, and\nhuman-centered, CDP is proof that innovative ideas are just the beginning. Speedo wanted to launch their next generation swim tracking product in time for it to be pre-installed\non a new Samsung wearable. So we quickly developed sophisticated algorithms to use\naccelerometer and gyro data to create reliable performance metrics. Unilever planned a market trial of their new soft ice cream offer, but their prototype dispenser had\ntechnical challenges. We identified and resolved the issues, re-engineered the dispenser, and then\nmanufactured 50 connected appliances that were installed in outlets across Europe. ?An in-depth understanding of core technology is critical to securing a long-term innovation pipeline.

Distributed sensors spot poacher activity over large remote areas and send threat alerts over a\nbespoke network to local wildlife rangers. Within 18 months the system was developed, prototyped\nand trialled in Kenya. It has won international acclaim and has enormous conservation potential. We were asked to resolve the difficult engineering and manufacturing issues that were jeopardising\nthis novel inhaler?s launch. Our team identified and resolved the problems, validated the design\nand production tooling so Voke could gain CE approval and enter volume manufacture. Catheter ablation is widely used to treat a range of abnormal heart rhythms. It involves passing a\nthin, flexible catheter through the blood vessels to the heart, where it pinpoints the arrhythmia and\nuses ablation to block the abnormal electrical signals. A more dexterous catheter increases success\nrates for patients and retains greater cardiac function. Drug delivery devices can be notoriously tricky to use, so our technology enables improved studies\nthat can distinguish use error from drug performance. This allows developers to focus investment\ncorrectly, reduce costs and accelerate a new treatment?s journey to market. ? Precision packaging, local ingredients, and the expressive Montreux Jazz Festival were the creative\ninspiration behind this new skincare collection design for VillaPhyta. When Crescendo?s route to launch looked blocked by quality issues at manufacture, our rapid\niteration of the vibrator?s sheath design cleared the way, enabling MysteryVibe to fulfil their first\norders for investor-customers. Patients suffering from chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis often\n\nfollow a complicated treatment regimen at home.

Katie Williams\nMechanical Engineer\nMatt Morris\nSenior Mechanical Engineer\nFrom phones to laptops, home devices to watches, electronic devices ? particularly smart devices ? have become part of people?s lives, enabling better communication and access to information and\nmaking their day-to-day easier. But the increasing adoption of technology comes at an environmental cost. Electronic devices often\nhave a significant carbon footprint because of the energy-intensive processes needed to produce\nprinted circuit boards (PCBs) and integrated circuits. Electronics production relies on mining and extracting dozens of different materials, including critical\nraw materials (economically important materials at high risk of supply shortage, such as lithium or\ntitanium). Extracting these materials has a range of sustainability impacts, including the leakage of\ntoxic chemicals such as cyanide into the environment, high levels of water use, and human rights\nabuses in the case of ?conflict minerals? such as gold and tantalum. Waste electronic products, or e-waste, is the fastest-growing waste stream in the world, with over 53\nmillion tonnes of e-waste produced in 2019. Most e-waste is disposed of incorrectly, ending up at\nwaste dumps in developing countries. Hazardous chemicals, such as lead or mercury, that may be\npresent in electronic components can leak into the environment, harming local ecosystems and\ndamaging the health of people who live and work in the dumps. Product sustainability has focused on the circular economy, particularly recycling. But there are\n\nfundamental limits to the impact recycling can have on electronics. Only 17% of e-waste is collected\nfor recycling and, even if it?s collected, recovering materials from e-waste is particularly challenging. Electronics contain trace amounts of rare metals, which are complex and expensive to separate. Only the most abundant materials, such as copper and gold, can be economically retrieved during\ne-waste recycling, and even if all e-waste was recycled in this way, the material recovered still\nwouldn?t be enough to meet the growing demands of the industry. One way to tackle the environmental challenges presented by electronics is to remove the need for\nthem in the first place, for example by detecting a temperature change using a color-changing\nchemical rather than a sensor.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"48f96037-1c39-4728-8c41-25a07ab7d83b":{"id_":"48f96037-1c39-4728-8c41-25a07ab7d83b","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/designing-more-sustainable-electronics.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"36mKyuIKMN9XrvYe/W2uIUShrDYsnuvf2cJo/okfHaw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"410cbff7-67ab-43f1-a275-284ea007bc82","metadata":{},"hash":"A2nQUHIvnS8QZFnyql4Umb1cvcc5C/oD4MU0gTS2JXk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"1e7eb121-5270-47b5-99f1-14b264f2145d","metadata":{},"hash":"d/ushLR9XW65IDZEqhMteo+EIMvg87bMDFDy8TWiL44="}},"hash":"3Sb7wXTg1us5fM7xTF15YTovs+e5ZPo/6meKEHnHTpg=","text":"But, in some instances, electronics are necessary, so how can\ndesigners reduce the impact of the products they create?Our sustainability team assessed a range\nof technologies and design techniques to determine their potential for reducing the environmental\nimpact of electronic products and how difficult they are to implement. This article outlines a few\napproaches we?ve used in recent projects at CDP. One of the best ways to reduce an electronic device?s environmental impact is by minimizing the\nelectronics? complexity, thereby reducing the number of integrated circuits needed as well as the\nsurrounding passive components (resistors, capacitors and so on), connecting tracks, and PCB\narea. An easy, effective way to do this is by pairing a product with a user?s existing device to provide the\nsmart capability. Methods range from a simple QR code or NFC chip to a Bluetooth connection for\ntransferring more complex data. As well as reducing the electronics in the product, this allows for a degree of futureproofing, as\nsoftware updates can be used to keep the product up to date. This idea isn?t new but is starting to\nbe used more in applications from smart packaging to medical devices. Important to note: Behind many of these software solutions are large data centers that need\npowering and should be considered in the product?s environmental impact. Designers can optimize component choices and circuit designs during detailed design to reduce the\n\noverall impact of a product. We recently used LCA to estimate the additional carbon footprint of adding an electronic module to\na medical device. This step allowed our team to identify where to focus on reducing the impact of\nthe design, such as replacing integrated circuits with a solution based on lower-impact passive\ncomponents and optimizing the layout to minimize the total area of PCB required. We identified several solutions that together had the potential to reduce the total carbon footprint of\nthe product by up to 25% without compromising functionality. In many cases, this optimization also\ngenerates cost savings. Over the past two decades, additive manufacturing (such as 3D printing) has seen a surge in use in\nmechanical prototyping and manufacture, and its applications in the electronics sector are now\nstarting to grow.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"1e7eb121-5270-47b5-99f1-14b264f2145d":{"id_":"1e7eb121-5270-47b5-99f1-14b264f2145d","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/designing-more-sustainable-electronics.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"36mKyuIKMN9XrvYe/W2uIUShrDYsnuvf2cJo/okfHaw="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"48f96037-1c39-4728-8c41-25a07ab7d83b","metadata":{},"hash":"3Sb7wXTg1us5fM7xTF15YTovs+e5ZPo/6meKEHnHTpg="}},"hash":"d/ushLR9XW65IDZEqhMteo+EIMvg87bMDFDy8TWiL44=","text":"In the context of PCBs, additive manufacturing refers to selectively adding\nconductive material to the areas required, as opposed to a more traditional approach which starts\nwith a layer of copper and selectively etches away the areas where it isn?t needed. These technologies can improve a product?s carbon footprint through reduced material usage and\nless energy-intensive manufacturing processes. A report published by the ECOtronics project found,\n?Changing from subtractive manufacturing (etching) to additive manufacturing (printing) has the\npotential to reduce environmental impacts by more than 50% across all impact categories.? One additive manufacturing method is laser direct structuring (LDS), which allows you to construct\ncircuits on the surface of device components. With this approach, you can remove the PCB entirely,\ndramatically cutting down on the material required. These technologies present opportunities to fit electronics into new form factors, print onto a wide\narray of rigid or flexible substrates (the non-conductive part of the circuit board the metal circuit is\nadded to) and increase the customizability of the design, all while reducing the product?s\nenvironmental impact. As we?ve highlighted before, sustainability initiatives should always consider context, which is vital\nfor electronics. In the absence of cost-effective recycling processes, designers must prioritize\n\napproaches that reduce the materials and energy required to produce electronics. As electronics\ncontinue to play a leading role in our lives, future designs should reduce our reliance on critical raw\nmaterials and consider how circular approaches to design can extend product lifetimes and prevent\nharm to people and the environment.
